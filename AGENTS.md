# AGENTS.md

BitFun is a Rust workspace plus React frontends.

Repository rule: **keep product logic platform-agnostic, then expose it through platform adapters**.

This file is the **formal standards entry** (progressive disclosure): indexes to authoritative
docs, plus the smallest always-on navigation. Open linked docs when the task matches; do not
copy long rule bodies back into this entry.

## Quick start

1. Read [`README.md`](README.md) and [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) before architecture-sensitive changes. Humans contributing via PR start at CONTRIBUTING; code-change norms start here.
2. Desktop: prefer `pnpm run desktop:dev`. Use `pnpm run desktop:preview:debug` only for faster frontend-only cold start (no Rust auto-rebuild). See [`docs/development/common-commands.md`](docs/development/common-commands.md).
3. After Rust edits: `pnpm run fmt:rs` (changed/staged `.rs` only). Use `cargo fmt` only when you intentionally want broader formatting coverage.
4. Use **Route by task** / **Standards map**, then pick checks from [`docs/development/verification.md`](docs/development/verification.md).

## How to use this file

1. Prefer the nearest module `AGENTS.md` / `AGENTS-CN.md` when editing under that directory.
2. **Standards map** = norm types. **Architecture index** = STD-01 subtopics. **Cross-cutting index** = host/logging/agent-loop topics. **Route by task** = change → read → verify.
3. Open linked authorities for detail. Keep this file and [`AGENTS-CN.md`](AGENTS-CN.md) in sync.

## Language (repo docs)

Summary only; full rules in [`docs/development/docs-governance.md`](docs/development/docs-governance.md).

| Kind | Language |
|---|---|
| Human-facing narrative | Chinese authority (English optional). Spec workflow index [`docs/specs/README.md`](docs/specs/README.md) is Chinese-authority. |
| Root `AGENTS` / `CONTRIBUTING` | Bilingual; **must stay in sync** |
| AI / code-change ops (`docs/development/*`, module `AGENTS`) | English authority |
| Logs | English only |

## Architecture index (STD-01)

When the task hits a row below, open that authority. Do not stop at the STD-01 map row alone.

| Topic | Open when | Authority |
|---|---|---|
| Product architecture | `bitfun-core` split, feature/dependency boundaries, build-speed refactors | [`docs/architecture/product-architecture.md`](docs/architecture/product-architecture.md) (see §1.1); topic map [`docs/architecture/README.md`](docs/architecture/README.md) |

| Agent hooks | Native Codex-compatible hooks, BitFun deviations / gates | [`docs/specs/agent-hooks.md`](docs/specs/agent-hooks.md) ([中文](docs/specs/agent-hooks.zh-CN.md)); do not fork the Codex hook contract |

| SDLC quality harness | Lifecycle evidence, gates, Artifact Graph, Project Profile, Deep Review, target-project governance | [`docs/sdlc-harness/README.md`](docs/sdlc-harness/README.md) → [`design.md`](docs/sdlc-harness/design.md); if module boundaries/behavior change, also matching docs under [`architecture/`](docs/sdlc-harness/architecture/) or [`features/`](docs/sdlc-harness/features/); do not hard-code BitFun-repo assumptions as target-project rules |

## Cross-cutting index

Condition-triggered rules. Open only when the task matches; details stay in the linked docs.

| Topic | Open when | Authority |

## Layered Module Index

Dependencies flow top to bottom. This table is the **physical** crate layout, not the full conceptual architecture — see Product architecture in the Architecture index. Keep crate dependencies inside each layer to the smallest set needed.

| # | Layer | Path | Owns | Modules / entries | Layer doc |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Interfaces and entrypoints | `src/apps/*`, `src/web-ui`, `src/mobile-web`, `BitFun-Installer`, `tests/e2e`, `src/crates/interfaces` | Product hosts, commands, UI entrypoints, protocol interfaces, and cross-surface tests | desktop, CLI, server, relay, Web UI, mobile web, installer, E2E, `acp`, `sdk-host` | nearest local `AGENTS.md`; [interfaces](src/crates/interfaces/AGENTS.md) |
| 2 | Product assembly | `src/crates/assembly` | Compatibility exports, product capability selection, product-full wiring, adapter/service registration, and ecosystem-neutral source coordination | `core`, `external-sources`, `product-capabilities` | [AGENTS.md](src/crates/assembly/AGENTS.md) |
| 3 | Adapters | `src/crates/adapters` | AI/transport/WebDriver protocol adapters, external AI work source adapters (OpenCode/Claude Code/Codex), and external-provider translation | `agent-runtime-ipc`, `ai-adapters`, `opencode-adapter`, `claude-code-adapter`, `codex-adapter`, `static-hook-support`, `transport`, `webdriver` | [AGENTS.md](src/crates/adapters/AGENTS.md) |
| 4 | Services | `src/crates/services` | Reusable OS, filesystem, terminal, MCP, remote, git, watch, process, LSP plugin registry, session persistence primitives, MiniApp runtime IO, and network implementations | `services-core`, `services-integrations`, `miniapp-market-service`, `relay-service`, `page-function-runtime`, `terminal` | [AGENTS.md](src/crates/services/AGENTS.md) |
| 5 | Execution primitives | `src/crates/execution` | Portable agent, harness, stream, DeepReview policy/report, plugin runtime client, typed-service, tool-contract, tool-group, and tool-execution building blocks | `agent-runtime`, `agent-stream`, `tool-contracts`, `harness`, `plugin-runtime-client`, `runtime-services`, `tool-provider-groups`, `tool-execution`, `tool-call-jsonrepair` | [AGENTS.md](src/crates/execution/AGENTS.md) |
| 6 | Stable contracts and product domains | `src/crates/contracts` | Shared DTOs, event shapes, runtime ports, LSP protocol/plugin DTOs, and product domain contracts/policies | `core-types`, `events`, `runtime-ports`, `product-domains` | [AGENTS.md](src/crates/contracts/AGENTS.md) |

Boundary rules:

- Interfaces expose selected product behavior; reusable behavior moves down.
- Assembly wires lower layers and selects capability facts; it must not implement concrete adapter, OS, or service details.
- Product features assemble user-facing commands, UI contributions, settings, and default policy on kernel capabilities; long-running task, scheduler, permission, session/workspace, memory, DFX, hook, and event facts stay in Agent Kernel owners.
- Adapters translate protocols and external-provider shapes; they do not own capability selection or reusable OS service behavior.
- Services implement reusable OS/process/terminal/MCP/remote/git/filesystem/LSP registry/MiniApp IO capabilities.
- External systems are boundary resources, not repo layers. Only registered adapters/services/app-local providers call them; others consume ports and stable contracts.
- Execution crates are portable runtime building blocks, not host or delivery-profile owners.
- Contracts stay behavior-light and must not depend upward.

## Agent-doc priority

Prefer the nearest matching `AGENTS.md` / `AGENTS-CN.md` for the directory you are changing. If local guidance conflicts with this file, follow the more specific nearer document.
