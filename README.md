### An open-source desktop AI agent — it ships code in your real repos, and drives your real desktop.

Code Agent · Cowork · Computer Use — local-first, on a Rust runtime.

## Install

**Download a build** — grab the latest installer from [Releases](https://github.com/GCWing/BitFun/releases/latest), install it, configure your model, and you are ready to go.

**Or run from source:**

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run desktop:dev
```

Prerequisites: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 22.12+ (LTS recommended), [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 10.15.0 via Corepack, the [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs/), and the [Tauri prerequisites](https://v2.tauri.app/start/prerequisites/). More detail in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

## What you can hand to BitFun

Two kinds of complex work: shipping code in real repositories, and turning source material into office deliverables. When a task needs the browser, desktop apps, the terminal, or a remote environment, BitFun can enter the real workspace.

| Scenario | Delivery goal | Typical capabilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Coding** | Move from a real repository to a mergeable result. | Agentic, Plan, Debug, testing, Git, Deep Review, long-horizon tasks, and benchmarks. |
| **Office Work** | Move from source material to deliverable documents. | Research, PPT, DOCX, XLSX, PDF, summarization, writing, meeting notes, and reports. |

**Shared capabilities**

- **Desktop execution layer**: Computer Use, browser operation, desktop apps, the filesystem, terminals, remote workspaces, and Mini Apps let the Agent enter real work environments.
- **Customization layer**: MCP, Skills, custom Agents, Mini Apps, and source-level extension let BitFun keep growing around your tools, roles, and interfaces.

## Agent core metrics

The data below evaluates BitFun's core Agent capabilities, all measured with **Deepseek-V4-Pro**.

> [!NOTE]
> These are BitFun's initial evaluation results, with each case run once. Benchmarks fluctuate with task sampling, model versions, runtime environment, and single-run variance, so treat these as an initial sanity signal that the Agent is already reasonably capable — not as a fixed ranking claim or a final ceiling. Full benchmark details will follow.

**1. Completion results** — BitFun leads Open Code and Claude Code on both **SWE-Bench-Pro** (complex software engineering) and **SWE-Bench-Verified** (human-verified GitHub issue fixes).

Benchmark references: [SWE-Bench-Pro](https://labs.scale.com/leaderboard/swe_bench_pro_public) / [SWE-Bench-Verified](https://www.swebench.com/verified.html)

**2. Token economy** — Agent economy needs to be evaluated across end-to-end token consumption, execution time, and KV Cache reuse. From the same SWE-Bench-Pro round, BitFun's average KV Cache hit rate was **98.67%**. The follow-up report will add broader cost and latency metrics.

![KV Cache hit rate distribution](./png/kv_cache_hit_rate.png)

**3. Context retrieval at scale** — Agent experience also depends on how quickly it retrieves context in very large projects. On tens-of-millions-line repositories such as Chromium, BitFun uses **flashgrep** to cut search time by up to **94.6%**, averaging a **36.1x** speedup.

## Customize your BitFun

BitFun's extension paths progress continuously from light to deep customization:

| Tier | Path | Best for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **L1** | Custom Agent | Defining roles, flows, constraints, and tool bundles. |
| **L2** | MCP / Skills / [Hooks](docs/features/agent-hooks.md) | Connecting external tools and professional capabilities, and running your own commands at Agent lifecycle points — fully Codex-hook compatible, so existing hook scripts work as-is. |
| **L3** | Mini App | Generating dedicated interfaces, forms, panels, or visualizations for tasks. |
| **L4** | Source-level customization | Changing tools, adapters, UI, Runtime, or product shape. |

You can use BitFun's Code Agent to extend BitFun itself.

## Where this is going

- **Lights-Out Factory** (in progress): Design during the day, let tasks flow to the server and run through the night, then review the results in the morning.
- **Infinite Radius** (in progress): Extending from desktop and browser to mobile, wearables, and more devices, so work stays accessible and continuous.
- **App Evolution**: Build tailored workflows with custom Agents, MCP, Skills, Mini Apps, or source-level customization. **Community contributors have already created specialized versions for short-form drama, media, and more**.
- **Better, Faster, Cheaper**: Pursue greater efficiency, better results, and lower cost.
- **Ultimate Desktop**: Continuously refine an easier-to-use, more capable, and more beautiful desktop experience.
