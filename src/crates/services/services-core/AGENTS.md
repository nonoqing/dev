# services-core Agent Guide

Scope: this guide applies to `src/crates/services/services-core`.

`bitfun-services-core` owns cross-platform service DTOs and helpers that compile
without the full product runtime. This includes generic filesystem/search/JSON
IO helpers, bounded local Instruction file reads, LSP package/protocol/watch/process primitives, session metadata
storage helpers, and local OS action primitives such as command lookup,
clipboard, file/url opening, script execution, workspace runtime FS/shell
providers, managed process-tree lifecycle, process-level Agent Runtime ownership locks, and system facts. Product crates may layer routing, policy,
capability selection, event emission, or legacy error mapping outside this
crate.

## Guardrails

- Do not depend on `bitfun-core`, app crates, Tauri, tool runtime, or product
  runtime crates.
- Prefer `bitfun-core-types` for shared DTOs and `bitfun-runtime-ports` for
  cross-layer traits.
- Keep dependency features explicit. Non-LSP consumers should use
  `default-features = false`; LSP consumers must enable the `lsp` feature.
- LSP manifest and protocol DTOs belong in `bitfun-core-types`; reusable LSP
  package, protocol, detection, debounce, watch, and process-manager helpers
  belong in `services-core`; product workspace state, event emission, global
  singletons, and file-sync orchestration stay outside this crate.
- Runtime call sites that touch agent execution, scheduler state, workspace
  managers, filesystem orchestration, or product behavior stay outside this
  crate. `workspace-runtime` may implement local `bitfun-runtime-ports`
  providers, but not workspace selection or product orchestration.
- `runtime_ownership` owns only canonical identity plus Embedded shared-lock and
  Shared exclusive-lock primitives. It must not select workspaces, start or
  cache Runtime instances, or define Session/Turn ownership.
- Do not add remote SSH, MiniApp storage, tool-result persistence, `PathManager`
  globals, or product runtime bindings to `filesystem`; keep those in core or a
  reviewed adapter/provider.
- Preserve legacy core imports with facade/re-export code when ownership moves.
- `process_tree` is the single reusable owner for supervised child-process
  lifecycle. Unix implementations use a dedicated process group; Windows must
  attach a suspended child to a kill-on-close Job Object before resuming and
  fail closed if attachment fails. Consumers own protocol shutdown; this owner
  owns cleanup for managed descendants and does not claim sandbox or
  resource-limit safety. Unix descendants that deliberately create a new
  session/process group are outside this boundary and must be treated as a
  disclosed residual risk until a platform supervisor is introduced.

## Verification

```bash
cargo test -p bitfun-services-core --features lsp
cargo test -p bitfun-services-core --features workspace-runtime workspace
cargo test -p bitfun-services-core --features runtime-ownership --test runtime_ownership_contracts
node scripts/check-core-boundaries.mjs
cargo check -p bitfun-core --features product-full
```
