# ACP Protocol Surface Guide

Scope: this guide applies to `src/crates/interfaces/acp`.

`bitfun-acp` owns the Agent Client Protocol surface over the assembled product
runtime. Keep ACP protocol/client details here or in app-surface adapters;
share only stable capability facts through contract crates.

The crate exposes two additive roles. `client` owns ACP process discovery,
configuration, remote probing, session transport, and tool-card projection; it
selects the Core Agent Runtime plus concrete SSH support. `server` owns the
CLI-hosted ACP server and runtime projection through `DeliveryProfile::Acp`; it
selects the exact Core tool, document, subscription, LSP, and external-source
owners used by that path, but does not select SSH. The compatibility default is
exactly `client + server`. Desktop selects only `client`; CLI selects both.
Keep these role features additive and do not replace either closure with
`product-full`.

## Guardrails

- Remote ACP workspaces reuse local ACP client configuration. Preserve the
  manager, remote shell probing, remote capability store, and workspace menu
  availability semantics when changing ACP client behavior.
- ACP config persistence, remote probing, timeout policy, and workspace surface
  selection are ACP/app-surface behavior. Do not move them into `core-types`,
  `runtime-ports`, or `agent-tools`.
- ACP external-agent tool naming, schema, validation, presentation, and result
  shape are portable contracts owned by `bitfun-agent-tools`; ACP should call
  those helpers instead of redefining them locally.
- Keep ACP stdio/connection ownership and protocol notification projection in
  this crate. Shared runtime facts may cross the SDK boundary; ACP protocol
  requests, client choices, and lifecycle state may not.
- If a future contract is needed, make it observational: environment identity,
  capability facts, and request/response DTOs only.

## Verification

```bash
cargo check -p bitfun-acp --no-default-features --features client
cargo check -p bitfun-acp --no-default-features --features server
cargo test -p bitfun-acp
```
