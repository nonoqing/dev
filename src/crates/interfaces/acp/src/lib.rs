//! BitFun Agent Client Protocol integration.
//!
//! This crate owns the ACP client and server surfaces over BitFun's assembled
//! runtime. Product hosts select the additive `client` and `server` features
//! explicitly; the compatibility default enables both roles.

#[cfg(feature = "client")]
pub mod client;
#[cfg(feature = "server")]
mod runtime;
#[cfg(feature = "server")]
