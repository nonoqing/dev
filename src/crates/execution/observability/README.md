# bitfun-observability

Portable, OpenTelemetry-SDK-independent contracts for BitFun telemetry.

The crate exposes typed Startup, Session, Turn, Round, Inference, Tool,
Permission, and Compression facts. The safe Trace/Metric/Log channel cannot
accept arbitrary attribute names, log bodies, JSON, errors, paths, prompts,
tool inputs, or tool outputs. Every safe record passes the static schema and
privacy gate before reaching `TelemetrySink`.

`TelemetryLevel::Debug` adds a separate, explicitly authorized sensitive Log
channel. It accepts only the closed `DebugTelemetryRecord` variants constructed
by authoritative owners. Each content field carries its redacted value,
original byte size, and truncation flag; fields share a deterministic content
budget and the serialized record has a final 256 KiB bound. The channel leaves
`ValidatedRecord`, `AttributeValue`, and the safe schema unchanged. There is no
generic event-name/body constructor.

Trace ownership stays at the real asynchronous operation boundary. Agent event
projection is deliberately limited to Metric and structured Log records from
authoritative terminal events; it must not reconstruct a Trace state machine.
