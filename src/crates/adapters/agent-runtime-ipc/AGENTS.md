# Agent Runtime IPC

Scope: `src/crates/adapters/agent-runtime-ipc`.

This non-published crate is the private local protocol used by the first-party Shared TUI adapter.
It provides discovery, one-instance locking, bounded framing, authenticated initialization, a closed interactive operation set,
session controller leases, event delivery, connection bounds, and cleanup. It is not a public SDK, remote protocol, service layer, or Runtime owner.

## Pre-integration contract

- Only consumer: the first-party interactive TUI adapter in `src/apps/cli`.
  GUI, Remote, Peer, ACP, Headless CLI, and SDK Host are not implied consumers.
- Stable test contract: platform-local endpoint, strict initialize-first handshake, separate handshake/request deadlines,
  128 KiB request and 8 MiB response/event limits, bounded connections, one controller per Session, one active Turn per connection,
  disconnect cancellation, sticky event-stream invalidation, 30-second idle exit, and owner-checked discovery cleanup.
- Integration check: the consumer must reuse existing Agent Runtime owners and
  prove Embedded/Shared behavior equivalence without depending on SDK Host.

## Boundaries

- Export only the exact workspace-private API needed by the CLI adapter. Do not
  publish this crate or expose its wire as an SDK contract.
- The closed operation budget is Health, Session list/create/restore/delete (including transcript on restore), current-Session rename and Agent mode/model update,
  declarative context reload, Turn submit/cancel, pending/respond Permission, and UserInput answers. Delete is limited to an idle Session not controlled by any client.
  Context reload may run during an active Turn, does not rewrite that Turn, and guards the cache so the next message reads invalidated instructions.
  Disconnect cleanup is internal lifecycle, not a detach operation.
  Model catalogs and defaults remain product configuration outside this wire. Do not add archive, fork, replay, observer,
  controller transfer, Tool/MCP/Hook management, or other product configuration incidentally.
- Stable Event, Product Domain, and Runtime Port DTOs may be reused. Do not
  depend on `bitfun-core`, Agent Runtime implementations, SDK Host, services,
  Tauri, terminal, tool runtime, or remote transports.
- Use only Windows Named Pipes or Unix Domain Sockets. Do not add TCP, HTTP,
  WebSocket, browser access, or remote fallback.
- Treat this as same-user local isolation, not a sandbox. Product composition
  must supply a user-private runtime directory.
- Embedded callers must continue to invoke the typed Agent Runtime directly and
  must not initialize this transport. Shared outgoing request, response, and
  event frames are encoded once before write; strict decoding, unknown-field
  rejection, frame limits, bounded queues, and backpressure must not be weakened
  for throughput.

## Verification

```bash
cargo test -p bitfun-agent-runtime-ipc
node scripts/check-core-boundaries.mjs
```
