# OpenCode Adapter

The current crate owns OpenCode user Instruction path/config precedence, the static OpenCode source preview used by the existing
managed-package path, the OpenCode-specific implementations of command,
standalone-tool, subagent, and MCP provider contracts, the bounded projection of
configured local Skill roots, and runtime-free mapping
of caller-normalized tool Hook descriptors. It preserves OpenCode source
discovery, precedence, formats, argument expansion, and versioned compatibility semantics.
Shared source catalog, lifecycle coordination, file-watch implementation,
product policy, UI, credentials, worker supervision, and final effect writes
belong elsewhere.

Product-source boundary:

- The current `load_opencode_package_adapter` entry remains static-preview only
  until OC-R1/OC-R2 replace its production role. Do not extend this P0 entry into
  another managed OpenCode package format.
- Standard OpenCode Command, standalone Tool, Subagent, and configured local
  Skill paths are current read-only live sources. Configured Skill URLs remain
  unsupported and must never be fetched. Full plugin directories and package specs
  remain target work rather than executable production sources. Source files need
  no BitFun import. Low-risk declarative results follow the
  user's auto-apply/ask preference; executable sources require a source, plugin,
  and execution-domain
  decision before first import. Broader pre-import execution permissions and
  post-import contribution expansion are separate gates, not repeated approval
  for every internal lifecycle state. Code updates may prepare automatically only
  when source identity/integrity, the source update policy, and the current
  execution conditions still allow it.
- A global source preference is deduplicated by source/plugin/execution domain, but
  every activation/import recomputes its effective source graph, working
  directory/environment, credentials, and policy. Workspace participates only when
  the owning config or logical plugin instance has workspace-specific state. Raw parsing
  and exact materialization caches may be shared; physical health follows the actual
  process grouping and is not keyed globally or by workspace by default. Crossing projects alone does not prompt again;
  only broader execution permissions, credential scope, or capability does.
- `ExternalSourceControlPlane` owns candidate versions and atomic provider
  replacement. This adapter supplies OpenCode-qualified source identity/order and
  watch roots through narrow provider contracts; the reusable file-watch service
  supplies change facts. Config modules provide normalized config snapshots; the services
  implementation behind `ScriptToolRuntime` owns dependencies, workers, process trees,
  and physical health; `PluginRuntimeClient` currently owns request reliability,
  diagnostics and fault status while consuming lifecycle facts from their responsible modules;
  capability modules register contributions.
- Effective policy and safe-start mode must be recomputed before third-party
  module import from the source, plugin identity, actual execution domain/user,
  product/organization policy bounds, credential scope, and environment scope.
  Discovery or config-import approval is not an execution decision. The product
  source experience and existing capability owners provide the source/plugin
  decision; this adapter consumes it but does not own prompts or trust state.
  After activation, the default local runtime policy is compatibility mode.
- Final tool creation, permission decisions, authoritative state, and audit facts
  stay in their tool, permission, product, and runtime owner paths.
- Standalone-tool preparation may return only a version-checked, bounded module
  for an already approved script. It must not spawn a process, install a package,
  persist approval, or interpret another ecosystem. Static import restrictions
  describe the current compatibility subset; they are not a security sandbox.
- The user's local `opencode` CLI installation is unrelated to loading
  OpenCode-compatible plugins. CLI/server interop with an installed OpenCode
  binary belongs to ACP/external-client work, not this adapter boundary.

## Boundary Rules

- Depend on stable contracts such as `bitfun-runtime-ports` and the
  `PluginRuntimeAdapter` boundary trait, not `bitfun-core`, app crates, Tauri
  APIs, product UI, or concrete service managers.
- Keep OpenCode config JSON, source ordering, loader compatibility, and argument
  expansion inside this crate. Cross-crate outputs use typed source snapshots,
  adapter bindings, and PluginRuntimeClient DTOs; do not expose raw OpenCode JSON
  or source syntax as product contracts.
- Current source inspection recognizes only the tested declarative subset. The
  adapter may reuse the workspace-pinned parse-only OXC profile for syntax-safe static
  projection, but it is not a general JavaScript/TypeScript semantic analyzer or
  runtime. Packages with no recognized entry and recognized unsupported hooks
  must produce diagnostics; other syntax is outside the compatibility claim.
- Unsupported OpenCode capabilities must be explicit diagnostics or typed
  unsupported candidates. Do not silently ignore them.
- Public APIs require a current Product Assembly consumer, a capability-specific
  provider contract, boundary updates, and focused tests. Do not expose generic
  OpenCode JSON access or add APIs only for target-design completeness.
- Runtime-free Hook mapping accepts only the `opencode.plugins` provider and is
  consumed by the existing managed-package `.js` / `.ts` read projection. OXC may
  extract static top-level property names from the exported plugin return object;
  the adapter owns their OpenCode meaning. Mapping may emit static declarations
  and diagnostics with incomplete safety. Parse failures must remain explicit
  diagnostics, while event payload types must not be treated as Hook properties.
  The adapter must not load handlers, dispatch Hooks, or imply executable support.
- The reviewed product assembly entrypoint selects and constructs the compiled
  OpenCode adapter/provider. External-source providers and configured Skill-root
  facts are projected through `bitfun-core/external_sources`; managed-package
  bindings are injected into PluginRuntimeClient. Product consumers do not
  import the adapter directly. The composition layer does not
  discover dynamic sources, prepare dependencies, or import plugin modules.
- Product Assembly may consume this crate only from reviewed composition modules
  such as `bitfun-core/plugin_runtime`, `bitfun-core/external_sources`, or
  `bitfun-core/instruction_sources`; boundary
  guards and focused assembly-path tests must change with any additional consumer.
- This crate must not depend on Codex, Claude Code, or another ecosystem adapter.
  New ecosystems are sibling adapters registered by Product Assembly, not modes of
  this adapter.
- Production crates must not depend on `bitfun_opencode_adapter` internals.
  Unsupported capabilities must return diagnostics or typed unsupported states
  instead of failing at runtime on external plugin content.
