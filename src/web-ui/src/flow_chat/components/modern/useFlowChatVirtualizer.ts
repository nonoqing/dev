/**
 * FlowChat's virtualizer.
 *
 * Everything that knows which library places the items lives here. The rest of
 * FlowChat asks for offsets in scroller coordinates and gets them back; it never
 * sees an index space of the virtualizer's own, because there isn't one —
 * measurements are cached against item keys, so a history prepend leaves every
 * measured item exactly where it was.
 *
 * The reason this is TanStack Virtual and not react-virtuoso is one line of its
 * measurement pass:
 *
 *     const size = measured ?? this.options.estimateSize(i)
 *
 * A per-item estimate for everything unmeasured. react-virtuoso reserves a
 * single scalar for all of them, and this transcript alternates 38px user
 * messages with model rounds up to 5012px, so the scroll range was wrong by an
 * order of magnitude until an item was actually measured. Scrolling into a
 * freshly paged block then forced a burst of measurement — stalls of 119ms and
 * 295ms with no animation frame at all — and a correction of up to 11705px.
 *
 * Items are laid out in normal flow inside a padded window, not absolutely
 * positioned. When an item inside the window changes height the browser reflows
 * the ones below it in the same layout pass, so there is no frame where the
 * scroll has been corrected but the items have not moved yet.
