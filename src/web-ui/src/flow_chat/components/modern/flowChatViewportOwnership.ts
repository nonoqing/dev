/**
 * Who is moving the FlowChat viewport right now.
 *
 * Several things move it, and each of them has to know not to fight the
 * others. That was a hand-written predicate per writer, which is O(n²) pairs
 * and fails the moment one is forgotten: a snap back was missing from the
 * anchor's copy, so the anchor undid the snap's own 0.7px of travel, the write
 * cancelled the animation, the cancellation read as a gesture coming to rest,
 * and the snap was re-issued 958 times over 20 seconds without arriving.
 *
 * The pairs collapse into one register. A writer claims the viewport for as
 * long as it is moving it, and everything else asks the register rather than
 * asking about each writer.
 *
 * The register decides *whether* someone may write. It never decides where the
 * viewport should go — targets stay with the writer that owns them, and the
 * correction that restores a reading position stays idempotent. Ordering
 * answers the question idempotency cannot: whether a movement was ours on
 * purpose or something to be undone.
 */

/**
 * Ordered most authoritative first. The order is the design; everything else
 * here is bookkeeping.
 *
 * - `user-gesture` — the reader's own hands, which nothing overrides.
 * - `one-shot-navigation` — a Turn, search hit, or focus request being reached.
 * - `snap-back` — returning from the reserved blank to the follow target.
 * - `follow-output` — the continuous writer that follows streaming output.
 * - `layout-correction` — the scroller's own box changed and a viewport nobody
 *   was following has to be re-aligned to the end it was resting against.
 *
 * The last is a correction rather than a movement: it holds the viewport for
 * the frame it acts in and yields to anything above it, because a movement made
 * on purpose is not a displacement to undo.
 *
 * **Repairing a displacement is not on this list at all.** Putting the reader
 * back after history arrived above them, or after a late measurement moved the
 * transcript under them, is `canShiftViewport` — a different question, with a
 * different answer for the reader's own gesture. See below.
 *
 * **The opening reveal is not here, and that is deliberate.** It is a phase
 * rather than a writer — the thing actually moving the viewport while the
 * transcript is hidden is follow-output — so ranking it above follow-output
 * would have follow refused by a claim standing in for itself. One slot cannot
 * hold a phase and a writer at the same time, so the reveal stays an explicit
 * condition where corrections are suppressed, alongside this register.
