     * What refuses it is almost always the reader's own gesture, and that claim
     * is a lapse timer — a wheel has no end of its own, so the register goes on
     * answering with them for a window after each notch. This correction is the
     * one writer that asks from inside that window, because coming to rest is
     * what triggers it.
     *
     * Which is also why the hold must not simply be released here. Tried, and
     * measured: a settle lands between two wheel notches, so releasing put the
     * snap back in the middle of a gesture that was still going — the reader
     * scrolled down into the reserved blank and was dragged back out of it
     * every 800ms, a dozen times, which is the transcript stuttering under
     * their hands. The hold was doing its job; what was missing was a second
     * ask once it had done it.
     *
     * So the ask repeats while the refusal is the kind that expires. A reader
     * still scrolling keeps re-taking the viewport and keeps being answered
     * with a refusal that moves nothing, and their next settle re-arms the
     * whole thing anyway; a reader who has stopped is snapped back one window
     * after their last notch.

   * The viewport was resized. Keep whatever was on the bottom edge on the

   *
   * A plain scroller preserves `scrollTop`, which anchors the *top* edge: the
   * bottom is where content gets revealed or swallowed. For a transcript that
   * is backwards — the interesting end is the bottom — so this anchors there
   * instead. Follow output already behaves this way for a viewport it owns;
   * this is the same rule for one it does not.
   *
   * The two halves are not equally capable, and the difference is worth
   * knowing:
   *
   * - **A height change moves no content.** Preserving `scrollTop +
   *   clientHeight` is therefore exact and needs no judgement about what the
   *   user was doing. It also preserves the distance to the content end, so a
   *   viewport that was at the end stays at the end for free. Growing the
   *   viewport is additionally a restoration: the browser used to clamp a
   *   bottom-anchored viewport at `scrollHeight - clientHeight`, and the
   *   resident spacer removed that clamp.
   * - **A width change reflows the transcript.** Where the line that was on the
   *   bottom edge went is a DOM question, and by the time a resize is observed
   *   the reflow has already happened — answering it would mean sampling an
   *   element anchor on the scroll path. The end of the transcript is the one
   *   position that can be recomputed from geometry, so that case is handled
   *   and the general one is not.
   *
   * Never animated. A height change moves the viewport by exactly the height
   * that was added or removed, so nothing appears to move at all; the rest is a
   * correction the user is already watching happen under their cursor.
   * Ownership does not change either: a gesture ending in the blank expresses
   * an intent to be at the end, a layout change expresses nothing.
