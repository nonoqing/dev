/**
 * What following the tail cost, and how rough it looked.
 *
 * Streaming output moves a viewport towards its own bottom, and there are two
 * such viewports in FlowChat: the message list, and the thinking card's own
 * scroll box once its content passes `max-height`. Both face the same question,
 * and the answers differ enough that guessing is not safe:
 *
 * - **How rough is it?** Markdown reflows a line at a time, so an unsmoothed
 *   follow moves in line-sized steps. Whether a smoothing attempt actually
 *   helped is a question about the *distribution* of step sizes, not the mean:
 *   a follow that is silky for a second and then jumps a line reads as jumpy.
 * - **What did it cost?** Changing the height of a list item forces the
 *   virtualizer to re-measure, which re-renders `VirtualMessageList`. Scrolling
 *   *inside* an item does not. That difference decides whether smoothing is
 *   affordable at all, and it is invisible from the outside — the two look
 *   identical on screen and differ by an order of magnitude in commits.
 *
 * So both are recorded together, over the same window, gated on
 * `app.logging.flow_chat_diagnostics`. Read against each other they answer the
 * only question worth asking about a smoothing change: did the steps get
 * smaller, and what did that buy or cost in list commits.
 *
 * Nothing here evaluates a payload while the switch is off, and a follow
 * running at frame rate reports once per window rather than once per frame —
 * sixty entries a second would bury the transition they exist to show.
