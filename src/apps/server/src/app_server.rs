//! Server-host app-server wiring: build the in-process `BitfunAppServer` from
//! the product-assembled [`AgentRuntime`] and return a cloneable handle.
//!
//! The containing Web Server was already deprecated before this refactor.
//! This wiring exists to validate the App Server boundary and is not required
//! to provide complete legacy Web/Desktop behavior or production compatibility.
//!
//! Under browser-direct ACP-over-WS (Step 2) the server host no longer pairs
//! the app-server with an in-process client over `in_memory_pair`. Instead each
//! WebSocket connection is handed straight to [`BitfunAppServer::serve`] via the
//! [`crate::routes::ws_transport`] `Lines` adapter, so the browser connects
//! directly to the in-process app-server over native JSON-RPC. This module only
//! constructs the [`BitfunAppRuntime`] and wraps it in a [`BitfunAppServer`]
//! (cheap `Clone` via the inner `Arc`); `serve` runs once per WS connection.
