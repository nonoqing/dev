# BitFun CLI

BitFun CLI provides an interactive terminal UI, non-interactive Agent runs,
session management, and machine-owned background tasks. Use `bitfun` for all
new scripts and integrations; `bitfun-cli` is a deprecated compatibility
entrypoint.

## Install

From the repository root:

```bash
pnpm run cli:install
```

The installer builds and installs both entrypoints for the current platform.
The default install directory is `~/.local/bin` on macOS/Linux and
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\BitFun\bin` on Windows. Open a new terminal after installation
so the updated `PATH` is visible.

Official release archives contain both executables. Keep them together when
extracting an archive; the compatibility launcher requires its sibling
`bitfun` executable.

Prerequisites for a source install are a Rust toolchain and this repository.
See the repository [contribution guide](../../../CONTRIBUTING.md) for development
setup and build commands.

## Quick start

```bash
bitfun                                  # interactive TUI
bitfun exec "summarize this project"   # one non-interactive Agent run
bitfun exec "run tests" --auto         # approve interactive tool asks for this run
bitfun sessions list
bitfun doctor
```

The interactive TUI asks before protected Agent tool calls. Non-interactive
`exec` rejects permission requests by default; use `--auto` only when the
current invocation may approve them.

Run `bitfun --help` or `bitfun <command> --help` for the complete command and
option reference.

## Interactive TUI

The most frequently used commands follow established OpenCode names where an
equivalent exists:

| Input | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `/sessions` | Browse and restore sessions. |
| `/new` or `/clear` | Start a new session. |
| `/timeline` | Navigate persisted user messages without changing the session. |
| `/fork` | Fork the full session or fork immediately before a selected prompt. |
| `/compact` or `/summarize` | Compact model context without deleting the saved transcript. |
| `/undo` / `/redo` | Move the persisted session timeline backward or forward. |
| `/diff` | Review staged, unstaged, and untracked workspace changes. |
| `/editor` | Edit the current draft with `VISUAL`, then `EDITOR`. |
| `/copy` / `/export` | Copy or export the visible transcript as Markdown. |
| `/status` / `/usage` | Inspect current-session status or cumulative usage. |
| `/reload [skills\|instructions]` | Refresh declarative context for the next message. |

The command palette and shortcut help show the bindings active in the current
configuration. `/editor` does not install or guess an editor. For GUI editors,
configure a command that waits until the file is closed; missing commands,
non-zero exits, and empty editor output leave the current draft unchanged.

### Shell mode

With an empty composer, type `!` to enter **SHELL** mode, matching OpenCode's
entry flow. The `!` marker becomes the input label and is not part of the
command. Press `Esc`, or press `Backspace` while the command is empty, to return
to chat mode. Shell and chat keep separate input histories.

Press Enter to run the command in the session workspace. Shell mode is
non-interactive: it does not allocate a PTY and does not accept image or
structured `@` attachments. A leading `/` is shell text, not a BitFun slash
command. The command uses the shared Agent Runtime, normal `ExecCommand` tool,
workspace binding, cancellation, audit, and static permission rules. Because
the command was explicitly typed by the user, an interactive `ask` is approved
without a second prompt; a configured `deny` still blocks execution.

The command and tool result are saved as a standard turn. Restoring the session
therefore shows the same tool card in CLI and Desktop instead of a CLI-only
transcript item.

### Image attachments

In Embedded TUI, use the configured paste action (`Ctrl+V` by default) or
terminal bracketed paste to attach a clipboard image or a local PNG, JPEG, GIF,
or WebP path. Quoted paths, `file://` URLs, and POSIX shell-escaped paths are
accepted. A message may contain up to five images, each no larger than 20 MiB.

Images are read when pasted, so later file changes do not alter the submitted
turn and local absolute paths are not sent to the Runtime. Slash commands and
Shell mode do not accept images. Shared TUI currently reports image paste as
unsupported and keeps the draft unchanged.

### Shared TUI

```bash
bitfun chat --shared
```

Shared TUI lets multiple terminal processes reuse one workspace Runtime. Each
TUI controls at most one session and a session has one controller. Core chat,
Shell mode, session navigation, model/mode selection, permissions, and
transcript events use the same behavior as Embedded TUI. Some local management
and attachment capabilities remain Embedded-only and report that limitation
instead of silently falling back.

Exit all Shared TUI clients and wait briefly before returning to the default
Embedded mode for the same workspace.

## Non-interactive output

Select output with `--output-format text|json|stream-json`:

| Format | stdout contract |
| --- | --- |
| `text` | Final Assistant text. Progress and diagnostics use stderr. |
| `json` | One final result object, including session/turn identity and usage when available. |
| `stream-json` | JSONL containing existing Agent events. |

`Ctrl+C` requests cancellation of the active turn. Session writer conflicts,
unsuccessful completion, an invalid event stream, and requested Patch failures
produce a non-zero result instead of reporting partial success.

## Other command groups

```bash
bitfun agents --help
bitfun models --help
bitfun mcp --help
bitfun plugins --help
bitfun hooks --help
bitfun config --help
bitfun acp --help
```

`bitfun mcp import` is an explicit preview/apply snapshot. It does not copy
credentials, headers, environment values, or explicit working directories, and
new native entries remain disabled until reviewed.

### Persistent tasks

`bitfun dispatch` is the machine-readable target-side interface used by other
BitFun surfaces. Jobs remain owned by this machine after the submitting client
disconnects. Controllers should call `dispatch probe` and honor the returned
protocol version before submitting or inspecting jobs. See the
[detached task architecture](../../../docs/architecture/detached-task-dispatch.md)
for the transport and workspace-snapshot contract.

### Always-on account device host

After signing in with `/login`, a server can keep its account device route
online without an interactive TUI:

```bash
bitfun daemon install
bitfun daemon status
```

Linux uses a systemd user service and macOS uses a LaunchAgent. Windows does not
currently install an auto-start service; use `bitfun daemon run` under a
supervisor instead. Run `bitfun daemon --help` for lifecycle commands and
platform diagnostics.

## Updates and troubleshooting

```bash
bitfun update --check
bitfun update
bitfun doctor
bitfun health
```

Official Linux archive installations perform a small, rate-limited update check
before interactive startup. Set `behavior.auto_update = false` in CLI config or
`BITFUN_CLI_DISABLE_AUTO_UPDATE=1` to disable it. Stable updates verify the
published checksum and, in official builds, the compiled release signing key
before replacing either entrypoint.

Use `doctor` for product/runtime assembly diagnostics and `health` for required
capability registration. They do not claim that external Network, Git, or MCP
services are currently reachable.
