# HarmonyOS App Instructions

These rules apply to all changes under `src/apps/mobile/harmonyos`.

## MVVM Refactor Boundaries

This app has one `entry` module, so MVVM is the file-organization boundary for
the module. Keep the official responsibilities explicit:

- Model/services own data access, persistence, transport, and business logic;
  they do not import views or page components.
- Views own presentation and user input; they consume projected state and emit
  intents/events rather than calling services directly.
- ViewModels bridge services and views by owning feature state, projecting data,
  and handling intents. ViewModels must not import components.

The following constraints are enforced incrementally by
`pnpm run harmony:architecture` (the runtime behavior checks remain in
`entry/src/test/ArchitectureUnit.test.ets`):

1. `services/**` must not import `../pages/`.
2. `pages/components/**` must not import `pages/viewmodel/`; imports of
   `pages/state/` and `pages/policy/` are allowed for observable state and pure
   policies.
3. The page dependency graph must remain acyclic; ViewModels must not depend on
   components.
4. Actions and Hooks use typed interfaces with object literals. Do not add
   position-dependent callback constructors.
5. New components use `@ComponentV2`; do not add V1 `@Component`, `@State`,
   `@Prop`, `@Link`, or `@Watch` declarations. `@BuilderParam` remains supported.
6. General Chat and Remote Chat shared observable fields belong to
   `pages/state/ConversationCoreState.ets`. Page-specific state objects compose
   that core and must not redeclare the shared `@Trace` fields.

The current local HarmonyOS verification loop is:

```bash
source scripts/ohos-env.sh
"$HVIGORW" --mode module -p product=default -p module=entry@default assembleHap --no-daemon
"$HVIGORW" --mode module -p module=entry@default -p ohos.test.type=LocalTest test --no-daemon
```

## Visual reference fidelity

- Before drawing a system glyph, text approximation, or new bitmap, search the existing HarmonyOS media resources and the approved desktop reference images. Reuse the established asset when one exists.
- Conversation header controls must use the approved `remote_ref_back` and `remote_ref_more` assets. Do not replace them with a system chevron or text such as `...` / bullet characters.
- Render monochrome reference assets in template mode and tint them with semantic theme colors such as `INK`. Never rely on the bitmap's original black or white pixels; the same control must remain legible in light and dark themes.
- Keep paired header controls on the same fixed touch-target size and optical alignment. A responsive layout may reposition a control, but must not silently change its icon geometry or visual weight.
- Keep `SymbolGlyph` geometry separate from its touch target. When a glyph is clickable or sits in a decorated control, wrap it in `Stack({ alignContent: Alignment.Center })` (or use a centered `Button`) and give the glyph its visual size; do not stretch the glyph itself to the full 32vp/40vp/44vp target, because font metrics can make the icon look off-center.

## Responsive interaction semantics

- Wide and compact layouts must keep the same interaction meaning. Responsive presentation may change spacing and available width, but it must not turn a lightweight anchored action menu into a bottom sheet by default.
- Conversation-header overflow actions open from the top-right trigger as an anchored popover on both compact and wide layouts. Use a bottom sheet only when the content is a genuinely large or multi-step mobile workflow and the design explicitly calls for it.
- Anchor popovers to their actual trigger with `bindPopup` or the equivalent platform API. Do not emulate the anchor with unrelated page-level absolute positioning.
- Preserve auto-dismiss, outside-tap handling, accessibility labels, and a short enter/exit transition for anchored menus.

## Theme and device verification

- Use existing semantic colors from `Theme.ets`; do not hard-code a light-only foreground or surface color.
- For changes to navigation controls, menus, or responsive presentation, verify compact and wide behavior, light and dark theme legibility, and capture a real-device screenshot before completion when a device is connected.
- Run the smallest matching HarmonyOS build/check plus `pnpm run theme:color-audit:all` for theme or color-related changes.
