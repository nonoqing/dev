# Architecture index

Purpose: complete topic map for stable architecture docs under `docs/architecture/`.
Scope: product runtime boundaries and cross-cutting design authorities.  
Status: stable  
Authority language: Chinese for most design bodies; this index is English for AI / ops navigation.

Governance: directories whose article set changes need a README — see [`docs/development/docs-governance.md`](../development/docs-governance.md).
Product norms entry: root [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md). Specs / plans: [`docs/specs/README.md`](../specs/README.md).

This directory owns stable cross-module boundaries and accepted designs. It
must not contain implementation task lists, user setup guides, benchmark dumps,
temporary review notes, or module-local coding rules. Proposed targets must be
marked as proposed and must not be presented as shipped behavior.
